# Purpose
This repository represents my attempts at learning to code by following the exercises on the [Beginner Projects subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects). While Python is my focus, I also hope to complete all of these projects using C and Ruby. I welcome suggestions for how I can improve my code.
